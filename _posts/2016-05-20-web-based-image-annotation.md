![image of grid]({{ site.url }}/assets/grid.png)

Allows sub-areas of an image to be manually defined. This is useful for observational-based psychology studies or creating training data for object/scene detection algorithms.

It uses a minimal set of tools: HTML5, PHP, and javascript. As such, it can easily be deloyed on any basic web-server.

Users can click squares defined by the grid-overlay to highlight portions of the image. Output includes a list of indices, indicating the set of squares clicked.
