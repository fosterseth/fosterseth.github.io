I am a developer at Red Hat working on the Ansible Automation Platform. Previously I worked for the Computational Cognition and Learning Laboratory at Indiana University. Here I wrote tools (in Matlab) to preprocess and visualize data collected from eye trackers, audio tracks, and motion sensors. I had a similar role at Duke University in the Cogan Lab, where we used electrophysiological recordings (EcoG and EEG) to study speech and language processing in the brain.

Non-programming interests - strategy games, cycling, following the NBA, watching films (particularly horror/sci-fi), computer hardware, painting (watercolor)
