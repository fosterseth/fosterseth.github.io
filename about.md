I am a developer at Red Hat working on the Ansible Automation Platform. Previously I worked in the research areas of psychology and neuroscience at Indiana and Duke Universities, respectively. Here I wrote tools (usually in Matlab) to preprocess and visualize data collected from eye trackers, head mounted cameras, motion sensors, audio recordings, and electrophysiology data (EcoG and EEG).

Non-programming interests - strategy games, cycling, following the NBA, watching films (particularly horror/sci-fi), computer hardware, painting (watercolor)
