I am a developer at Red Hat working on the Ansible Automation Platform. Previously I worked for the Computation Cognition and Learning Laboratory at Indiana University. Here I helped develop tools (in Matlab) to preprocess and visualize data collected from eye trackers, audio tracks, and motion sensors. This data served to explore open questions regarding language learning in infants. I had a similar role at Duke University in the Cogan Lab. Here we used brain activity data (EcoG and EEG) to the speech and language components of human cognition.

Non-programming interests - strategy games, cycling, following the NBA, watching films (particularly horror/sci-fi), computer hardware, painting (watercolor)
