Hi! Thanks for visiting my page. This will serve as a platform for me to share some of my programming-related work, and maybe post some tutorials from time to time. I've had the great opportunity of working alongside a team of researchers at the [Computational Cognition and Learning Laboratory](http://www.indiana.edu/~dll/research.html), where we strive to understand the intricate details of how infants learn language from natural environments. Most of my efforts go into building up and maintaining a research infrastructure that relies on automation of tasks, data visualization, and data pattern exploration.

Outside of programming, I enjoy spending time with my family, wading through soundcloud to find new music, working on my bicycle, following the chaos of the NBA season, playing board games, and watching (good) horror films once in a while.
